Albania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire on 28 November 1912, accompanied with the establishment of the 
Senate and Government by the Assembly of Vlorë on 4 December 1912.[74][75][76][77] Its sovereignty was recognised by 
the Conference of London. On 29 July 1913, the Treaty of London delineated the borders of the country and its neighbors, 
leaving many Albanians outside Albania, predominantly partitioned between Montenegro, Serbia and Greece.[78]

Headquartered in Vlorë, the International Commission of Control was established on 15 October 1913 to take care of the 
administration of newly established Albania, until its own political institutions were in order.[79][80] The International 
Gendarmerie was established as the first law enforcement agency of the Principality of Albania. In November, the first 
gendarmerie members arrived in the country. Prince of Albania Wilhelm of Wied (Princ Vilhelm Vidi) was selected as the 
first prince of the principality.[81] On 7 March, he arrived in the provisional capital of Durrës and started to organise 
his government, appointing Turhan Pasha Përmeti to form the first Albanian cabinet.

In November 1913, the Albanian pro-Ottoman forces had offered the throne of Albania to the Ottoman war Minister of 
Albanian origin, Ahmed Izzet Pasha.[82] The pro-Ottoman peasants believed that the new regime was a tool of the six 
Christian Great Powers and local landowners, that owned half of the arable land.[83]

In February 1914, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was proclaimed in Gjirokastër by the local Greek population 
against incorporation to Albania. This initiative was short-lived, and in 1921 the southern provinces were incorporated 
into the Albanian Principality.[84][85] Meanwhile, the revolt of Albanian peasants against the new Albanian regime erupted 
under the leadership of the group of Muslim clerics gathered around Essad Pasha Toptani, who proclaimed himself the savior 
of Albania and Islam.[86][87] In order to gain support of the Mirdita Catholic volunteers from the northern part of Albania, 
Prince Wied appointed their leader, Prênk Bibë Doda, to be the foreign minister of the Principality of Albania. 
In May and June 1914, the International Gendarmerie was joined by Isa Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo,[88] 
and northern Mirdita Catholics, were defeated by the rebels who captured most of Central Albania by the end of August 
1914.[89] The regime of Prince Wied collapsed, and he left the country on 3 September 1914.
