Albania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire on 28 November 1912, accompanied with the establishment of the 
Senate and Government by the Assembly of Vlorë on 4 December 1912.[74][75][76][77] Its sovereignty was recognised by 
the Conference of London. On 29 July 1913, the Treaty of London delineated the borders of the country and its neighbors, 
leaving many Albanians outside Albania, predominantly partitioned between Montenegro, Serbia and Greece.[78]

Headquartered in Vlorë, the International Commission of Control was established on 15 October 1913 to take care of the 
administration of newly established Albania, until its own political institutions were in order.[79][80] The International 
Gendarmerie was established as the first law enforcement agency of the Principality of Albania. In November, the first 
gendarmerie members arrived in the country. Prince of Albania Wilhelm of Wied (Princ Vilhelm Vidi) was selected as the 
first prince of the principality.[81] On 7 March, he arrived in the provisional capital of Durrës and started to organise 
his government, appointing Turhan Pasha Përmeti to form the first Albanian cabinet.

In November 1913, the Albanian pro-Ottoman forces had offered the throne of Albania to the Ottoman war Minister of 
Albanian origin, Ahmed Izzet Pasha.[82] The pro-Ottoman peasants believed that the new regime was a tool of the six 
Christian Great Powers and local landowners, that owned half of the arable land.[83]
